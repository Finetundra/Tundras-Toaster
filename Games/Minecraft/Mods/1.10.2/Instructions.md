# Installing the Modpack

The new modpack that we'll be using this time works differently than in the past as there's more tweaking that we did to it. As such, if you're new or if you've played with us before, you might want to give these instructions a look over

## Getting Started

First off, you'll need to have ATLauncher downloded and set up. If you don't have it already, you can find download links [here](https://www.atlauncher.com/downloads) or on the main page for our [Github](https://github.com/Finetundra/Tundras-Toasters) 

Also, in the event you don't have a 64bit Java 8 Install you can find the download [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) or you can also find it on the main Github page. You must click the "Accept License Agreement" button under "Java SE Runtime Environment 8u172". After, you must download the relevant version for your system. Windows users should download the first Windows x64 option, MacOS users should download the first MacOS version. Linux users should obtain the package through their preffered methods. 

##ATLauncher

For ATLauncher you will first need to log in to your Mojang/Minecraft if you haven't already done so. Once you have done that you'll need to click the "Settings" tab on the right. Then from there click the tab called "Java/Minecraft" and set the value for "Maximum Memory/Ram" to at least 5120. You will be presented with a prompt, just click OK. 

Now that that is done, you'll now need to go to the "Packs" tab and search for Resonant Rise. Select "New Instance" on the first option choose the latest version (Note: This will likely be the defauly option) and then click "Install". You'll be presented with another menu, please click "Select Recommended" and then click "Install" (Or whatever other button that would indicate to proceed with install).

Once it has finished downloading select the "Instances" tab and then select "Open Folder" for the Resonant Rise instance (Note: Please keep in mind that if you have used ATLauncher before there may be other Instances listed. You can use the search bar to locate the new Resonant Rise one). Please leave the resulting file manager window open for the next steps.

##Aditional Mods

*This time around we have added a number of additional mods. As such there is presently no easy way to distribute them to our users. The following steps will address how presently to add the new mods.*

*First you'll need something that can open 7zip files. Because steps will vary for different archive managers the following steps will address 7zip on Windows ONLY. If you have any questions, or use a different manager, or are unsure if you have one, or which one you do have, questions may be directed to Finetundra.*

So, assuming you have followed the instructions above till now you should have a file manager window open. If you don't, then go and do the instructions above. Once you have that window open, then open your web browser (Popular options include Internet Explorer, Safari, Edge, Firefox, and Chrome) and download the file from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DnuOcCqb-2ILew-yfDG4SA_God489V7Z). This contains the extra mods you'll need. 

Once it's been downloaded, you'll find the file in your Downloads folder. Navigate to your Downloads folder and locate the file. Then right click the file and go to the 7zip menu and select the option "Extract to "Test_Pack_0001\"" option. It'll request that you provide a password. Please ask one of the members of the Discord channel for the password. After the file has been extracted, navigate to the new folder in your Downloads folder that shares the name of the file. 

If you've made it this far, great! You're almost done. Now the last step that you need to do is drage the "mods" folder from Test_Pack_0001 into the ResonantRise folder that should already be open in another window. When prompted, select "Replace the files in the destination" 

##End

Now that you're at the end of all this, you can close the file manager windows. From there you can go to ATLauncher's "Instances" tab and select "Play" on the Resonant Rise instance and you should now be able to get in game. Please be patient as the pack takes quite a bit of time to launch the first time or two. You can find server information on the main Github page or you may ask one of the Discord channel members.
